Quick Commerce Operations & SLA Performance Analysis (SQL)

This project simulates a quick-commerce backend similar to Blinkit and analyzes delivery performance, revenue leakage, and operational risks using SQL.

Using real transactional data, the analysis identifies cities with high SLA breach rates, revenue at risk due to late deliveries, underperforming stores, and high-risk SKUs that require priority inventory and operational interventions.

The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to uncover operational inefficiencies, quantify business risk, and generate data-backed recommendations for improving service reliability and customer experience.
